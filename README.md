# GPS-Guided-Bot
GPS Enabled+Obstacle Avoiding+Shortest Path Finding Bot

In this project, I plan to create the hardware and software aspects of a GPS Guided Bot. 
It would have the following features:
1. It would be GPS enabled to pin-point locations. We can input upto 5 waypoint locations.
2. It would avoid obstacles in its path using ultrasonic sensors.
3. It would also be able to detect the shortest path.
It will be controlled from an app which also will need to be designed.

Please refer to the presentation where I have detailed the mechanism, working method and the components needed.

After successfully executing this project, I plan to design a module which will contain few basic sensor applications so that anybody can design a basic bot with multiple features by buying just a single module instead of many different modules.
